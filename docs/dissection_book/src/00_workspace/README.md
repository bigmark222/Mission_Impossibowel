# Workspace

This chapter orients you to the workspace as a whole:
- how crates depend on each other
- the core runtime/data flows
- the shared contracts that keep capture, training, and inference aligned.

Expect dependency graphs, integration boundaries, and the maintenance routines that keep the stack coherent.
